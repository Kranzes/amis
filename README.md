# NixOS AMIs
[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/arianvp/amis/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/arianvp/amis)

Temporary home for the soon to be official NixOS AMIs

## Costs and Sponorship

Testing all this and storing all the AMIs whilst I figure out moving this to the
NixOS Foundation costs me non-significant amount of money.  If you think this
cause is worthwhile please consider sponsoring me through Github Sponsors.

Each image is `4GB`  in size at the moment. EBS Snapshots cost  `$0.05` per GB
per month. So each image costs `$0.20` per month to store.  We replicate  across
all 32 AWS regions so that's `$6.40` per month per image.
